# 3D Cameras can archaeologists afford them?

360 degree cameras have been around for a few years now.  They come in multiple sizes, qualities and prices rangs.  For the purpose of introducing them into archaeology there are a number of models that archaeologists may want to look into.

An example of a cheaper model is the Samsung's Gear 360, which has a front and back facing cameras.  The model is small, compact, and could be a good device for use in the field.  With a pricetag going from $300-$500 USD, the samsung model is much easier to access.  additionally, there are other companies selling handhelp 360 cameras for under $200, for example the LG 360 CAM goes for under $150 USD.  The LG model is a handheld camera that contains a fisheye lens.  The third option that I have looked into is the Sphericam 2, which is on a kickstarting campaign.  The goal of the sphericam 2 is to have a higher quality camera, in a sphere shaped device to get a full 360 view of any space.
